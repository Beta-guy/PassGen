# PassGen
Password Generator Project

Just a simple project to get my feet wet in Python

# Installation:
just download:

passgenGUI.py

requirements.txt

open a commandline to the directory with passgenGUI.py and requirements.txt and type:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Linux users will need to create a venv to get it to work.
